# Phase Gates — Session Cursor

Status tracker for the phased build of `aws-devops-sdet-demo`.
Each phase ends with: STOP → checklist → validation commands → explicit
confirmation before the next phase. This file is the "where we are" cursor.

## Completion criteria & validation

### Phase 0 — Discovery / preflight
- Criteria: AWS account model confirmed; demo account ID, region, SSO profile,
  GitHub owner/repo/branch, devbox status, owner tag, state bucket name fixed.
- Validation:
```bash
  aws sso login --profile demo-admin
  aws sts get-caller-identity --profile demo-admin   # Account must be the demo account
```

### Phase 1 — Lightsail devbox prep
- Criteria: devbox provisioned (Ubuntu 24.04, static IP, SSH-only); toolchain
  installed and version-verified.
- Validation:
```bash
  docker --version && docker compose version
  aws --version && terraform version
  node --version && python3 --version && git --version
```

### Phase 2 — Minimal local app skeleton
- Criteria: FastAPI app (/, /health, /api/health, /api/db-check); SQLAlchemy
  model demo_items; Alembic revision 0001; static index.html with test ids.
- Validation:
```bash
  python3 -c "import app.src.main"   # imports cleanly
  ls app/alembic/versions/           # revision 0001 present
```

### Phase 3 — Docker Compose + local tests
- Criteria: Dockerfile (psycopg2-binary, non-root); docker-compose (postgres:16
  not exposed + app:8000, healthcheck); migrate/seed/db-assert; Playwright
  smoke; Makefile (9 targets). All run for real.
- Validation:
```bash
  make local-up
  curl -s http://localhost:8000/health
  curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/db-check
  make migrate && make seed
  make test-db
  make test-smoke
  make local-down
```

### Phase 4 — Terraform foundation
- Criteria: infra/bootstrap (S3 state bucket, local state, README);
  infra/envs/{stage,prod}/backend.tf (S3, use_lockfile); 8 modules (network,
  ecr, alb, ecs, rds, iam_github_oidc, observability, budgets); stage filled,
  prod scaffold; outputs without secrets; fmt + validate clean; lockfile
  committed. NO terraform apply/destroy. NO real backend init.
- Validation:
```bash
  terraform fmt -recursive -check
  cd infra/envs/stage && terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate
```

### Phase 5 — GitHub Actions + OIDC
- Criteria: ci.yml (local Docker Compose, fmt, validate -backend=false, no AWS
  creds); deploy-stage.yml (OIDC, build/push, init/plan/apply, run-task
  migrate/seed/db-assert, smoke, artifacts); destroy.yml (confirm=DESTROY,
  verification step).
- Validation: workflow files present; `terraform validate` passes in CI path.
- GitHub config notes (carry forward to Phase 6+):
  - 6 vars live as ENVIRONMENT variables under environment `stage` (not repo-wide):
    AWS_REGION, OIDC_ROLE_ARN, TF_STATE_BUCKET, TF_VAR_BUDGET_EMAIL,
    TF_VAR_DEMO_ACCOUNT_ID, TF_VAR_OWNER. No secrets (OIDC).
  - Visible only to jobs with `environment:` set. deploy-stage (environment: stage)
    and destroy (environment: ${{ inputs.environment }}) see them; ci.yml has no
    environment and needs no AWS, so that is fine. A future AWS job WITHOUT an
    `environment:` would NOT see these — add the environment or duplicate as repo vars.
  - Variable was named OIDC_ROLE_ARN, NOT GITHUB_OIDC_ROLE_ARN: GitHub reserves the
    GITHUB_ prefix for variable names. Workflows reference vars.OIDC_ROLE_ARN.
  - These vars only work AFTER the local first apply creates the deploy role
    aws-devops-sdet-demo-stage-github-deploy (Phase 6). Until then Actions OIDC fails.


### Phase 6 — First AWS stage deploy
- Criteria: bootstrap applied locally (state bucket exists); first stage apply
  LOCAL (creates OIDC provider + deploy role); ALB/ECS/RDS healthy; migrate +
  seed + db-check + smoke pass against AWS.
- Validation:
```bash
  aws ecs list-clusters --profile demo-admin --region us-west-2
  aws rds describe-db-instances --profile demo-admin --region us-west-2
  aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --profile demo-admin --region us-west-2
```

- Phase 6 learnings (carry forward):
  - Run the first/long applies under SSH-disconnect protection (nohup or tmux):
    RDS takes ~5-10 min and Lightsail browser SSH drops long commands. A dropped
    apply got SIGHUP mid-create, leaving a stuck S3 lockfile + orphaned resources
    (public subnet, ALB) created in AWS but absent from state.
  - Recovery pattern: `terraform force-unlock <id>` (id from the .tflock JSON in
    S3) → `terraform import` each orphan (subnet, ALB) → plan (0 to destroy) →
    re-apply (idempotent, finishes the rest).
  - app_image has no real default: local apply must pass
    -var="app_image=<ECR_URL>:<sha>" or it reverts the service to the :bootstrap
    placeholder. Actions sets TF_VAR_app_image itself.
  - DB-assert bug found & fixed (commit 36ecfba): deploy-stage.yml ran
    python tests/db/assert_seed.py inside the app image, but the image is built
    from context app/ and does not contain tests/. Added app/scripts/assert_seed.py
    (ships via COPY scripts ./scripts); workflow now runs scripts/assert_seed.py.
    tests/db/assert_seed.py stays as the local `make test-db` gate.
  - CloudWatch log stream format is app/app/<task-id> (awslogs-stream-prefix=app),
    not ecs/app/<task-id>.

### Phase 7 — Destroy validation
- Criteria: destroy removes ECS/ALB/RDS/ECR/logs/VPC; state bucket remains;
  re-apply after destroy succeeds with no name conflicts (repeatability).
- Validation:
```bash
  aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways --profile demo-admin --region us-west-2   # none
  aws eks list-clusters --profile demo-admin --region us-west-2           # none
  aws ecr describe-repositories --profile demo-admin --region us-west-2   # app repo gone
```
- STATUS: DONE (2026-06-08). Stage torn down; verified zero billable resources
  (ECS/RDS/ALB/ECR/logs/VPC/secret all empty; no NAT, no EKS, no unattached EIP).
  State bucket aws-devops-sdet-demo-tfstate-993912191738 intentionally remains.
- HOW: teardown completed via LOCAL `terraform destroy` (AWS_PROFILE=demo-admin),
  NOT via destroy.yml end-to-end. The first Actions-OIDC destroy run surfaced two
  latent deploy-role bugs, both fixed in commit 2c1efcc:
  (1) trust policy allowed only sub=ref:refs/heads/main; destroy.yml runs with
      environment:stage -> sub=...:environment:stage was denied. Added
      github_environments var; trust now permits both ref and environment subs.
  (2) the role's permissions inline policy was absent in AWS (state/AWS drift
      from an interrupted Phase 6 apply); the Actions run got AccessDenied on
      s3:PutObject to the state bucket. Re-created via local targeted apply.
  Both fixes are committed and the live role was corrected, but a full
  end-to-end destroy.yml (Actions OIDC) run was NOT re-validated after the fixes.
- NOT DONE (deferred, by user decision): repeatability-check (fresh apply after
  destroy to confirm no name conflicts). Also not validated: destroy.yml
  end-to-end via Actions OIDC. Both to be closed in a later cycle if needed.

### Phase 8 — Repeatable lifecycle via CI + feature expansion
- C2 refactor (ADR-0015): GitHub OIDC provider + deploy role moved OUT of
  infra/envs/stage into infra/bootstrap-oidc/ with its own remote state
  (key bootstrap-oidc/terraform.tfstate). Fixes destroy.yml self-deleting the
  deploy role's own permissions mid-destroy. Also: IamManageScoped narrowed to
  the two ECS roles only (no longer matches the deploy role itself); deploy-role
  GetSecretValue scoped to <name_prefix>-db-credentials-* wildcard; retry commit
  8d3ed9d reverted to a plain terraform destroy step.
- Bootstrap ordering is now TWO local-first applies per cycle (demo-admin):
  (1) infra/bootstrap (S3 state bucket), (2) infra/bootstrap-oidc (OIDC + role).
  After both, deploy-stage.yml and destroy.yml run end-to-end via Actions OIDC.
- Criteria to close: local apply bootstrap-oidc -> local/Actions apply stage ->
  deploy-stage.yml green via Actions -> destroy.yml green via Actions WITHOUT
  failing on self-deleted permissions -> green verification step.
- Further feature expansion: defined per future request (see docs/next-phases.md).

## Confirmation protocol
Advance only on explicit confirmation: `continue`, `confirmed`, `done`,
`phase complete`, `go next`, `ок`, `дальше`, `подтверждаю`.
On error: fix the current phase only; do not advance.

## Manual sync reminder (do at EVERY phase gate)
Project files (discussion-log.md, project-prompt.md) are READ-ONLY copies in the
Claude Project and are NOT in git. Chat edits do not save back. So at each phase
gate, after the small "mark phase done" commit, MANUALLY update the Project files:
- Update the "Current state" / phase cursor in discussion-log.md to the new phase.
- Add any new decisions/gotchas (e.g. the GitHub vars notes above) to the right
  section of discussion-log.md.
- If the build prompt scope changed, reflect it in project-prompt.md.
Claude must remind the user to do this manual sync as part of every phase-gate
STOP summary. Source of truth for code = git; source of truth for narrative
context across chats = the Project files (only the user can update them).
